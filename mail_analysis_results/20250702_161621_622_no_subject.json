Reference is made to PL25008aILf: IMO MSC 110 5 - Papers 5 15, 5 16, 5 17, 5 18, 5 21 - To Review. 2. Regarding item 4, NK has the following comments; MSC 110 5 16 Ø The term of override is used in the relevant documents of SOLAS(.. Performance Standards for Water Level Detectors) with not defining specially. Accordingly, NK considers that it is not necessary to define the term in MASS Code to align with the other documents. MSC 110 5 18 Ø NK concerns the proposal that the term of control should be included in the definition of MASS Code since the term is categorized as the general term. NK considers that it is better to consider the necessity of this matter again after deciding the definition of the term of Operator Control Modes(OCM) .
