Reference is made to PL25008aILf dated 20 May 2025. 2. Answering item 4., please note BV comments: 1. MSC 110 5 15 (UK): The paper is supported. BV supports the UK proposal to focus on MASS-specific requirements in Chapter 16 (Maintenance and repair) and avoid duplication with existing SOLAS requirements. 1. MSC 110 5 16 (China): The paper is partially supported. The need - to define the term override more precisely, - to require tests and simulations before issuing an interim certificate, - to improve data recording requirements, is supported: these various points should be discussed in more detail by the MASS working group. 1. MSC 110 5 17 (China): The paper is partially supported. China proposal in 3 4 to modify the definition of the operational envelope is not supported. China proposal in 5 to retain figure illustrating key concepts (OE, ODD, degraded state, fallback state) is supported, and the figure 1 proposed by China in 6 7 should be discussed in more detail by the MASS working group. China proposal in 13 to clarify the concept of Operator Control Modes (OCM) and its relationship with Modes of Operation (MoO) is supported and should be discussed in more detail by the MASS working group. 1. MSC 110 5 18 (Norway): The paper is partially supported. Norway proposal to clearly define the concept of supervisory control and its subcategories is supported and should be discussed in more detail by the MASS working group. 1. MSC 110 5 21 (Russian Federation): This paper is partially supported. The importance of addressing cybersecurity issues in the MASS Code is supported. The additions to chapters 4 and 9 as proposed by Russia are not supported. They should be subject to detailed discussion by the MASS working group.
