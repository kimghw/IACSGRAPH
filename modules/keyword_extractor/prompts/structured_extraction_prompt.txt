}

## Sender Organization Detection
- Extract organization from the sender's email domain (e.g., @kr.org → KR, @lr.org → LR)
- If domain is not clear, look for organization signatures in the email content
- Common domain patterns:
  - @kr.org, @krs.co.kr → KR
  - @lr.org → LR
  - @dnv.com, @dnvgl.com → DNV
  - @classnk.or.jp → NK
  - @eagle.org → ABS
  - @bureauveritas.com → BV
  - @ccs.org.cn → CCS
  - @rina.org → RINA
  - @prs.pl → PRS
  - @iscsmaritime.com, @iacs.org.uk → IL (Chair)
  - @tasneef.ae → TL
  - @crs.hr → CRS
  - @irclass.org → IRS
  
# Rules

## Overview
The SDTP panel consists of ABS, BV, CCS, CRS, DNV, IRS, KR, LR, NK, PRS, RINA, and TL as IACS members, with IL serving as the panel chair. The IL chair creates agendas and panel members reply with their opinions to the chair and other members.

## Email Prefix Handling
- For emails with "RE:", "Re:", "Fw:", "FW:", "Fwd:", or similar prefixes:
  - Extract the ACTUAL sender's organization from the email content, not from the subject line
  - The agenda_Reference should be based on the original email being replied to or forwarded
  - The agenda_reponseid should reflect the ACTUAL SENDER's organization code + reply version

## Sender Organization Detection
- Extract organization from the sender's email domain (e.g., @kr.org → KR, @lr.org → LR)
- If domain is not clear, look for organization signatures in the email content
- Common domain patterns:
  - @kr.org, @krs.co.kr → KR
  - @lr.org → LR
  - @dnv.com, @dnvgl.com → DNV
  - @classnk.or.jp → NK
  - @eagle.org → ABS
  - @bureauveritas.com → BV
  - @ccs.org.cn → CCS
  - @rina.org → RINA
  - @prs.pl → PRS
  - @iscsmaritime.com, @iacs.org.uk → IL (Chair)
  - @tasneef.ae → TL
  - @crs.hr → CRS
  - @irclass.org → IRS

## Agenda Reference Pattern
- Standard format: [Panel][Year][Number]_[OrgCode][ReplyVersion]
- Examples: PL25003_ILa, PL24005_NKd, PS25003pPLa, JWG-SDT25001a
- For cross-panel references (e.g., PS25003pPLa), maintain the full pattern

## Decision Status Guidelines
- "created": Initial request or notification from Chair
- "comment": Member providing opinion or feedback
- "consolidated": Chair summarizing multiple member responses
- "review": Request for review or member stating they are reviewing
- "decision": Final decision or approval announced
- null: When status is unclear or not applicable

## Mail Type Classification
- "REQUEST": Asking for input, review, or action with deadline
- "RESPONSE": Reply to a request or providing requested information
- "NOTIFICATION": Informing about decisions, events, or updates
- "COMPLETED": Reporting completion of task or final submission
- "OTHER": General correspondence not fitting above categories

## Special Cases
1. Test emails or system emails: Set all agenda fields to null
2. External organizations (not IACS members): sender_organization = null
3. Joint communications: May have special panel names like "JWG-SDT"
4. Automatic replies: Still extract sender_organization from email headers
5. Korean language emails: Extract and translate key information accurately

## Deadline Extraction
- Look for keywords: "by", "까지", "deadline", "due", "마감"
- Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
- If only date is given without time, assume 23:59:59
- If deadline is mentioned but unclear, set has_deadline=true but deadline=null
