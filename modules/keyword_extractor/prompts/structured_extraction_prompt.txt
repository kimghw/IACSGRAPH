## RULES

### Deadline Extraction
- **IMPORTANT: Begin by separating the response portion from the original request portion in the email, and disregard the request content when calculating deadline estimates.
- **IMPORTANT: Only extract deadlines for email replies/responses, NOT for meetings, events, or other activities**
- **CRITICAL: Only extract deadlines from the CURRENT email content, NOT from forwarded/replied original emails**
- **CRITICAL: Any content after author signatures (e.g., "Best Regards", "Sincerely", "Kind Regards", "Thanks", "Regards", "BR", "감사합니다", "안녕히 계세요") must be completely ignored**
- **CRITICAL: Even if not explicitly marked, content that appears to be forwarded or from previous emails should be ignored. Signs include:**
  - Different writing style or context
  - References to different senders/recipients
  - Content that seems disconnected from the main message
  - Multiple date/time references in different contexts
  - "From:", "Sent:", "To:", "Subject:" headers appearing in the middle of content
- Ignore any content after markers like:
  - "-----Original Message-----"
  - "From:", "Sent:", "To:" headers indicating forwarded content
  - "> " (quoted text indicators)
  - "On [date] wrote:" patterns
  - "--- Forwarded message ---"
  - Email thread separators
  - _____ Od:
  - Author signatures followed by additional content
- Look for keywords that indicate reply deadline in the NEW content only: "reply by", "respond by", "response required by", "feedback by", "comments by", "회신 기한", "답변 요청", "의견 제출"
- Ignore deadlines for: meetings, conferences, submissions (unless it's email response), events, registrations
- Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
- If only date is given without time, assume 23:59:59
- If reply deadline is mentioned but unclear, set has_deadline=true but deadline=null
- If email mentions meeting dates or event dates but no reply deadline, set has_deadline=false

### Mail Type Classification

- "RESPONSE": Reply to a request or providing requested information
