Rules:
1. Extract up to 5 most relevant keywords
2. For pl_patterns:
   - Look for patterns like: PL25003_ILa, MSC108/3/1, MEPC81/INF.23
   - Extract PL patterns from the email's Subject line
3. If no patterns found, return empty array for pl_patterns
4. Email chain handling:
   - ONLY analyze the MOST RECENT message (before any "From:", "Sent:", "Subject:" headers)
   - Ignore quoted or forwarded content below the main message
5. Parse deadlines carefully:
   - ONLY consider deadlines mentioned in the current sender's message
   - If email is addressed to "Chair" or "Panel Chair", do NOT treat dates as deadlines
   - Only extract deadlines directly requested by the current email sender
6. Determine mail_type:
   - REQUEST: asking for action, response, or submission
   - RESPONSE: replying to a request (e.g., "I prefer option 2", "Here are my comments", "Dear Chair")
   - NOTIFICATION: informing about events, decisions, or updates
   - COMPLETED: summarizing or compiling multiple opinions/responses from different parties (e.g., "Following are the compiled comments from members", "Summary of responses received", "Consolidated feedback from all parties")
   - OTHER: doesn't fit above categories
7. Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text
